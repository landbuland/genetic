# Naive Bayse Classifier with its application in R.

## Abstract
In this note, I would like to have a basic overview about the Naïve Bayes Classifier, which is a useful and fundamental probabilistic model in machine learning, as well as its principle in need and realization with R.

## Foundation – Bayes Theory
The Naïve Bayes Classifier is based on the Bayes Theorem (alternatively Bayes rule), describing that the correlation between conditional probabilities of two  events. It could be written in the mathematical language as follows.

Where P(A|B) means that the incidence of A given event B is observed, while $P(A) $ means the probability of observing event A independently. For same reason, the explanation of P(B|A) and P(B)  are similar. 
As a result, we would be able to predict P(A|B)$ with the knowledge of P(A),  P(B)  and P(B|A).
